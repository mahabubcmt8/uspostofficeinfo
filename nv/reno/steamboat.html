<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I just waited 90 minutes in the Steamboat branch in Reno, 5 people including myself came in with passport appointments during that time, NONE of us had photocopies of documents, we didn't realize we needed copies. I ended up allowing the person ahead of me to take my appt when she got back with her copies while I left to go get copies, in the end I let someone who was after me be helped and I rescheduled because she was making a scene.  How about you put a copy machine in that branch??? You could make a fortune making copies and people wouldn't get into such a stress trying to get a document in time to travel.  My trip will now be cancelled, nice guys finish last as they say.</div>

In all the times I have been, over the years, my experience matches the reviews of everyone else. Clearly, the issues will not be addressed by management, as they truly do not care. Yes, you should expect horrible treatment if you are forced to subject yourself to this branch. They are consistent. It is an exercise in how much you can stand to deal with, each time. Unfortunately, they do not seem to need to change, because we are forced to use their services. Maybe a neighborhood petition for change is the answer. We all would sign it.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Over the years, we've had multiple cases of mis-handled mail - either stuff to wrong addresses, or in a couple of cases, signature-required mail was left in the box.  Today when I got the mail out of our cluster mailbox, I was surprised to see daylight through the box after pulling my mail out - walked around the back and the entire back of the cluster mail box was wide open - no evidence of vandalism - looks like the carrier left it open when he/she moved on to the next box up the street.  I took photos, and will make sure the local and regional managers see this.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">The USPS delivered my parcels to someone else and have not resolved the situation. I have tried to contact my USPS location by email and have only received automated responses. Somebody opened a case for the incident, and apparently closed it without telling me, because I received an after resolution survey card. They did place new, large lables on each parcel box so the post-person wont mix it up in the future, which I can only assume is in response to this as they have been confusing for residents for years. Where's my camera? Where is the groundwork to locate this lost parcel? Where is the communication? I feel like its bad customer service like this that brings up the question, why do we still use the post office? I was one of the few people that liked The Postman, but I am not a big fan right now.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">The last 2 times USPS in 89511 made Amazon Prime deliveries there were problems. The first time instead of next day delivery it took 4 days it was so late I canceled the order and reordered the sme product  and th second order got here a day earlier than the first one.
The second problem was worse I ordered some surgical masks and they never were delivered. And on the tracking the USPS showed it was delivered Saturday March 7 at 4:07 pm and left in my mailbox. There were 2 letter type articles but no masks. I complained to Amzon and they said it was probably still in his vehicle and he scanned it when he or she put in their vehicle and to call them back Monday March 9 after the mail is delivered. I called them back Monday March 9 when it still was not here and they are sending another one that should be delivered March 11 but since it's comining via U SPS I can only hope that it gets here. I don't know if tha last one ws lost or stolen by the postal employee.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I am extremely frustrated with the delivery. Whoever delivers to my house is incompetent. I order from amazon and never have delivery issues unless USPS is involved in the delivery. First they tried to deliver bar stools in my mailbox instead of on the porch like ever other carrier. Yesterday i checked to see where a package was and it said failed delivery attempt because driveway and sidewalk was not accessible. I thought that was weird. So i checked the camera and they never came to my house nor was anyone blocking my house. It was a shoebox. Not sure how much room is needed. I truly wish either your drivers would deliver or amazon would quit using your service. If people wanted to go stand In line to pick up an item they would not use amazon. They would go to the store. Worst delivery service. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I have a complaint. We used to get our mail around 1:00pm to 3:00pm.  As more people keep coming to Reno to reside, our mail now comes between 7:00pm and 8:00pm. This really is not acceptable, especially now that winter is here. I assume that outgoing mail does not go out until late the next day. Something really needs to be done. You really need more drivers for the expanding location.</div>

However, when the male carrier comes, he crams packages in our mailbox, and we have to tear the boxes open to get them out.  Today I found part of our mail in the street, and all scrunched because of a package that didn’t fit.  
That being said, there is no excuse for him not to bring it to our door since we have a roundabout in our yard!  </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">4 lost Amazon packages in 2 months. 
Here's what they do: they mark the package as delivered, even add that they left it at the front door. That is simply NOT TRUE. They are incompetent to begin with, uncaring from the top down and allowing delivery personnel to lie about deliveries that are NOT made. 
I've complained directly to them, to UPS and to Amazon. I opened a case online at USPS. That is the only thing that might get their attention. 
I now have to really think about ordering from Amazon Prime since I never know if or when I'll get what I order. Why UPS and/or FedEx don't buy the USPS and put them out of their misery is a mystery to me. 
Our government incompetency at its worst right here in Reno. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Service Complaint. The USPS post office at the Steamboat location in Reno Nevada refuses to deliver the package we ordered through Amazon.com. The package is not too large or too heavy, but it won't fit in the "Neighborhood Cluster Box". I asked for a "redelivery" to the residence scheduled for 7-13-2018. It was not delivered. I called the Steamboat post office many times to resolve the issue but no one answers the phone ever (775-853-2615). I contacted Amazon, they said that USPS was under contract to deliver the package to the residence. Amazon contacted the USPS Hub office and we filed a claim on 7-14-2018. I'm filing this complaint (to USPS) because this "Steamboat" post office is known for this kind of poor service. The reviews on-line for this post office are evidence of the poor management at this location. I would like very much for my package to be delivered to the residence, that's what we paid for. Maybe the management at the Steamboat post office needs to be looked at!</div>

There have been times that I dropped the packages off before noon...yet they didn't scan till the next day.  Not only that, there's a worker there that is very rude to people who have stood in line to mail their things but may have questions. Rolls her eyes...and talks down to people like her time is being wasted on them. She was rude to me several times when I first moved here till the day I told her she had no right to be rude to me when I ask a question or need a service. She snapped put of it and started being nice. But, I stand in line a hear how she talks to customers and I just want to slap her.  this is a very lazy postoffice that seems to get away with not doing its job.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">The Steamboat Post office has lost several of my packages which they claim have been delivered. No package was found at the front office or at my door and no drop box key placed in my mailbox or a delivery slip left. As stated previously,  this has happened on multiple occations. Either a post office employee is stealing or incompetent and the situation rectified. I have had to call the company to have the package redelivered, such delivery will be completed by UPS. <br/></div>
