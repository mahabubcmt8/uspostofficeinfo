<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">We live in Lee and can't get packages delivered to us. First I was told we must live within a half mile of mailboxes, which we do. Then told they won't deliver on a non-maintenanced road...it's a private road. Whatever happened to their motto: Neither rain, hail, sleet or snow will keep them from delivering? It's a dirt road and it is maintained by the people on the road, just not by county. It's a good thing I have a vehicle and can drive to get them. Why are we paying for our mail to be delivered and not get it delivered? I am going to stop using USPS for packages to ship and to receive. How about putting a package box down there with the letter boxes? That would be too easy!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I. talked to the post master yesterday and problem is NOT resolved- I got a note yesterday saying our item was not delivered because the gate was closed. I opened it at 7AM and our mail usually comes from 12 to 2 PM. If anyone drives up to the house we have a pack of outside dogs (fenced yes) that bark making the house dogs bark so we go to see what is going on. NO barking yesterday. No package .today. We have also had to take mail to neighbors a couple of times lately and had some of ours delievered to a different neighbor (told us he had some of ours but did not bring it down for a month- glad it was not important! Never got my  Chase bill couple of months ago and they wanted to add $39 to my bill because I did not pay it on time! That was twice the amount charged on the card to begin with. Have no idea where it went. Odd that FedEx and UPS people can drive right down to out  yard and we run out when the dogs bark and interact with them with no problem</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I want to commend the post office in Live Oak. The clerks have been kind and patient with me.  When I am looking for some pretty stamps, they get out whatever they have and show me with great patience.  They do a great job. Our carriers have been great. Our netflix movies arrive on time in our mailbox 99% of the time. The carriers bring packages to my front porch. They have always been cordial even when obviously they were in a hurry. So they leave the mailbox open sometimes. So what? We should be glad these people are doing this work to get our mail to us even during this crisis when they put their lives on the line every day to do it. I truly appreciate the mail service in Live Oak, and the United States Post Office in general. Keep up the good work!!

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">My Carrier has been leaving my orders from online on the ground next to my mail box. Which is next to the street. It was very upsetting knowing the amount that I have spent on these orders just for them to be tossed on the ground like trash and in the open for someone to just take. The postal service has no concern for people orders/mail. If it was being done to them they would not like it. Please show some concern when dealing with someones ,mail treat it as you would want yours to be treated. Im going to file a complaint with the U.S POSTAL Services Consumers Advocate Office. Then file a complaint with the USPS Office of Inspector General. This is very unacceptable. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This is the third time that someone has stolen something I ordered from Amazon.  The Amazon site shows it listed as delivered and it does not arrive.  I believe there is a thief on my route.  I had to discontinue mail meds because they arrived a week late, with the package opened.  This tells me that obviously it was tampered with.  I live in a rural area and online shopping has been wonderful except for this.  Last year I lost 200.00 in online shopping.  This year so far I have lost 8.50 and I want it to stop there.  I cannot trust your postal delivery.  You do not do what you say you do.  Consider this a formal complaint.  If I need to I will gladly come in person to discuss this matter with the postmaster himself. I am home constantly and there is no explainable reason why I would miss a delivery on this or any other date. I can't trust you, but more importantly you should know that the person who delivers my mail can't be trusted either.  My address is 8895 145th drive off of 136.  I have advised everyone that they cannot trust you on facebook and with the seller.  The statistical improbability of these things just going missing when I am home all the time by error is nil.  Plus, they drive like crazy.  Like a bat out of hell.  In times like these certainly you can find more reliable people to deliver the mail who do not endanger our pets or the security of our mail.  

Sincerely, 
Yngvildr Odinsdottir</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This is the worst post office ever. Very uninformed and incorrect on mailing procedures and prices, also, some of the rudest people ever as managers, etc. The clerks are fine, it is management that needs to be changed!!!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Your employee Chris and Live Oak Post Office FL was down right rude.  Just now,11:00 AM 10/10/17, I was trying to determine if a Guaranteed Delivery NEXT DAY EL756813574US Express Mail, which was NOT delivered on the next day, would be delivered today 10/10/17.  I told him it had NOT been delivered the next day (Saturday 10/7/17) despite the Business having a drop box and the fact that there was someone at the business at the time, 11:30 AM Saturday, that the carrier reported the business as being closed. Chris told me that the business had given the Post Office instructions not to deliver mail on NON business days.  A fact that I told him I was not aware of.  Whereupon he summarily hung up on me without so much as an "If you please."  I then called him back and again asked him if the Express mail would be deliver today 10/10/17 as it is the next business day.  In view of the fact that he had checked the tracking number, that the piece was logged into the Live Oak Post Office and he knew the Express Mail would be delivered today 10/10/17 he again became "testy", matter of fact and officious by repeated Post Office Policy and Procedure instead of simply reassuring me with a simple "yes" that the piece would be delivered today, as he knew it would be.  Next time maybe UPS can do a better job.</div>
