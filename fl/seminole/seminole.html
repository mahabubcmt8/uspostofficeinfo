<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I would like to say that I have good experiences with this post office. In addition our mailman Jerry is wonderful.   I would like to add to the complainers out there that if you see a mail person on their phone in their truck how do you know they're not having a break aren't they entitled to a lunch break or break during the day? In mark in addition somebody has to be last on the route it's sort of sucks if it's you but everybody can't be 1st the post office just like everyone else is having a very hard time finding employees I think they're doing the best that they can in a bad situation.</div>

I live at Lake Seminole Square and for some reason we have been slated as the last stop of the day. This means that our mail comes anywhere between 4:00 and 7:00 on any given day.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I live on Indian Hills Ct in Bardmoor north Seminole.  
We have a new postman.  I do not know his name.  I know that you will be able to figure out who our mail person is as I have put in our address. But, he is not very good at doing the mail.  I have just received my second envelope that has been bent and shoved into the mail box.  The first envelope ruined an antique family picture frame.   The second envelope came from a business, I ordered on line. The envelope says priority on the envelope.  I do not understand why this man has to jam envelopes into the mailbox.   He bends and pushes them in to make them fit.    Our other mail person did not do this.  I have never had a mail person bend and push envelopes in to a mail box to make them fit. 
I have talked to him about not doing this.  Obviously it did not help.   Please someone,  anyone please talk to this postman.  </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Hmmmm “After weeks of railing against online shopping giant Amazon, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday creating a task force to study the United States Postal Service.
In the surprise move, Trump said that USPS is on "an unsustainable financial path" and "must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout."

Interesting!
Today I went the Seminole Post Office and one of my goals was to get a check cashed…a check sent to by the USPS.  For some reason the check did not include my name—just “NA”…but it had my address.

Since the “NA” raised a red flag I asked to see the Supervisor.  She was GREAT---explained to me how even tho this was a USPS check and that this was a USPS office and she was a USPS Supervisor…this was MY problem to solve.  Did she offer to call her supervisor? NOPE. Did she say “Let me make a phone call.  We’ll figure this out.” NOPE. I was going to have be an upaid volunteer for the USPS and resolve their error myself.
Since that didn’t sit well I asked to speak with her Supervisor [since she chose NOT to ask for another opinion].  Well…once again I was going to have solve the USPS problem---this supervisor also couldn’t find a way to call anyone---maybe HIS supervisor?  Both supervisors seemed to want to nothing to do with this and showed ZERO INITIATIVE [presumably that’s why the supervise instead of working for a living!].

So I asked for the name and location of HIS supervisor.  She’s up in Largo--- that will be Thursdays job.
I presume she will be more capable at conflict resolution and will find a way to get this check cashed.  
And while Im there Im getting names of the Supervisors from this [Seminole] office--- this needs to go on the USPS Facebook page. Presumably the supervisor in Largo will ensure a satisfactory solution----and spare everyone being mentioned by name in my recounting of  this ridiculous and unnecessary incident!
I wish I could have gotten away with this kind of behavior when I worked at two County governments in Florida.  But we were taught to SOLVE problems—not exacerbate them!!

and to think...my business ships ~$7000 per year worth of stuff thru THIS OFFICE ALONE...and has for 4 years; throw in the amount of stuff that comes to me via this office.....hmmm....doesnt the United Parcel Service deliver packages?  This office would NEVER miss my paltry $7k.....and i could ask my shippers to use UPS....

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Well today I went to the Largo main branch to try and cash a USPS check that neither of two supervisors at the Seminole branch would touch---as noted above, USPS mistake wasnt the USPS's problem to resolve it was mine.  

Fortunately, the Largo Branch has Ms Beverly Yates as the Supervisor--and she was right up front---working for a living!

Ms Yates gave "fast food" a bad name---after confirming my address was identical to that on check she personally approved payment.  

Ms Yates EXEMPLIFIED what Customer Service issupposed to be.  Perhaps she should offer a training course for the "pass the buck" individuals pretending to be supervisors at seminole!!

Thank you so very much Ms Yates!!!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I mailed a father's day card recently and while at the post office the clerk told me it needed to be "hand sorted" because it felt like it had something attached to the card that may cause problems with machine sorting. She marked it "HS" for hand sort and that was the last I saw of it and my father did not receive it. The card was heavy and did have a medallion attached to it that may have felt like a piece of jewelry. I have sent my father man many cards over the past 55 years and this is the first time this has happened. I usually place a few dollars in with the card as a token gift and it has always arrived. Not accusing the PO of theft nor this location however the "hand sort" is suspect and probably tempting to some. The money is not the issue. Its the integrity of the PO system and personnel. I am disappointed that my father did not receive his card and at 93 he was disappointed as well until I contacted him and inquired about the card. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This post office delivers mail to me.  I have experienced some of the most damaged mail I have ever seen.  They continuously shove things into the mail box that do not fit.  They often rip and tear envelopes, and packaging.  The stuff things into my mailbox that come out in a wadded up ball.  Most of the time the ball of paper is just ads, and coupons.  <br/>I don't ever really ask for all the ads and coupons, however they come anyway.  I find it appalling to destroy other mail, because they seem mad at the world about delivering junk mail.<br/>The other thing worth mentioning; I have lived here in this area now for 8 years.  Not once have I received my mail service the same time two days in a row.  They seem to come and go when they please.   I'm not even speaking of an hour our two hour difference.  This is a vast difference from 10 a.m.  to 6 p.m. and any time in between.  <br/>I live in a large apartment complex.  When I first moved in I noticed a "no parking, postal service only from 10-3".   I thought that was a very large time span to allow delivery.  No they have just painted white paint over the sign and wrote with permanent marker, "10-6".  <br/>It is very frustrating to not have dependable delivery.  I can never make a plan based on any payment or checks I should receive in the mail, as I don't know if they will even arrive before the bank closes.  And if they arrive prior to bank close, it will most likely be after the bank has changed to the following business day for processing.<br/>I can't believe how terrible the service is provided.  I would guess this is why the USPS is going out of business basically and keeps reducing their staff.<br/>I myself will stick with FedEx.  Or the always convenient and easy e-mail.</div>

Written on it says "No Names = No mail"  and the thank you is crossed out on the bottom of the form.

<br><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Dana, It's not rocket science. And yes it is perfectly legal.
If you last name is Williams, they will only deliver mail addressed to Williams. They make a note in the sorting office and also in your mail box. Think of it as a last check to ensure a temp delivery guy gets the right mail in the right box. It also stops you getting mail for Brown, which would cause you to freak out and complain on this Non US Postal website. 
Your name &amp; address is public record (as you'll find out at election time)
Just because they didn't ask you 30 years ago, doesn't mean they can't ask you today, and think of it as betterment. 
if this is all that you have to complain about, chill out and relax before you Stroke out.</div>

He/She was busy working doing something important, rather sat in an office doing sweet FA waiting for you to complain. Or where you expecting them to drop everything and rush over to you. And what would your complaining to them, having to listen to you whine for at least 10 mins plus another 10 for making you wait. When what's done is done, mistakes are made, they handle millions of pieces of mail a day, one or two a likely to get misplaced.  You complain to make yourself feel better, not a supervisor that had nothing to do with the error feel crappy and offer a fake apology for you to come running back here and whine all over again. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Tried to call post office and No Answer.  Wanted to complain about the service I have been receiving as well as my neighbors.  We use to have a Great postal person Dan, and he retired.  These young kids do not care how they deliver mail or they cannot read addresses.  I mailed my rent check on November 25, my landlord never received it.  My neighbor mailed 3 bills on November 25, and she incurred late fees because they never received her payments.  I just had my neighbor bring me a letter from  the IRS that was very important information I needed.  The address Clearly states my correct address.  I swear these younger people just don't care!!!!!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">The worst postal service I have ever confronted in my entire life. I made a phone call to the office stating I did not want them spamming me with junk mail the way they do and they said they did not care and that I have no property rights. They will send whatever they feel like if it's addressed to my address. Which is a form of solicitation. In the United States constitution it states each and every citizen has a right to own property. I believe it's being more than infringed upon with these people stating we haven't any rights regarding what gets sent to OUR PROPERTY. Despicable human beings. The manager was whom I spoke with on the phone and he was rude as can be and then hung up on me.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Jens, The PO does not have the power to censor your mail for you. They have their work cut out for them. If each citizen like you and me started to instruct them on how to handle our mail, even if they were allowed to selectively reject or accept mail on our behalf (which they are not), they would need to increase their staff a great deal. The way you avoid junk mail is by contacting the sender.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">The correct way to stop soliciatations by mail is to register online (they have snail mail options too) at <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov" rel="nofollow">www.consumer.ftc.gov</a> You can stop unsolicited phone calls, emails as well as the snail mail. Good luck</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I was at this post office this morning, where I received very cold and robotic service. The employees here look miserable and seem like they are annoyed to be interacting with customers. Let's change this demeanor please, there are plenty of people who would kill to have your job and actually smile about it.</div>
