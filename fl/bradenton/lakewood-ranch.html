<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I live on Colebrook Circle in Del Webb. Next to my house at 17522 Colebrook is a mailbox station serving a portion of the houses in Del Webb. It has a service apron and a sidewalk in front to allow homeowners to pull off the street to get their mail. There is grass on  each end of the apron. 

Since we moved in the mail carrier has driven the mail truck across the grass to get on the apron to service the mailboxes. Thinking that this area might be too small for the truck to maneuver, I asked the builder to enlarge the apron. it was completed two days
ago and is now twice the size it was. Two mail trucks could easily fit on it. 

Be that as it may, yesterday and today I saw the mail carrier drive across the grass, leaving  deep ruts that will have to be repaired.  There is no reason for this. Please make those who deliver mail to that mailbox complex aware of the damage they are causing and direct them to stay on the pavers.</div>

Also, this is a security risk as the box was so full that mail could have easily been stolen.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">We have a marvelous full-time postal delivery person, but the staff at the facility including the postmaster needs reminding that they are in business because of the customer, US.  I received a package in the mail that was put into one of the postal boxes by our mailbox.  However the fill-in worker forgot to check that the key actually works.  Have made three attempts to use their key in their box and the key will not go in.  60 minutes one the phone with over 10 hangups, I was unable to talk to anyone.  No wonder they are losing money.  My only hope is to stop the full-time person and ask for help, the postmaster must be on Covid distant service.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Have gone to my local Post Office four times over the last week receiving disappointment on each occasion.  It's crazy that on multiple times there are more cars in the lot than parking spaces and an enormous number of people cramped into the lobby even before opening time! Tonight at 7:00 PM I went yet again to put a few letters in the box outside the office. Amazing,  the box was overfilled with letters on the ground in front of it. The box was packed and supposedly emptied at 5:00 PM. I doubt it, but if so, another box should be placed next to it to accommodate the increased demand of the holiday season. USPS not what it used to be. Sad.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">We closed on our new home on Oct 27, 2020. The local post office still does not have our address. We bring our Informed Delivery notices and go to the Lakewood Ranch Post Office every other day. We maybe get 2-4 pieces of the many we have Informed Delivery notices for. Today I stopped by and when I asked for my held mail I was sent to the end of the row to an empty window. After 5 minutes or so, I saw a different employee happily help his customer that had mail being held. Finally someone came to help me and said I only had 3 pieces  of the 14 that was in Informed Delivery 11/20-11/24 and that they don't acknowledge Informed Delivery as it takes up to 7 days for them to receive the mail that I see in my Informed Delivery emails. We just moved here from Clermont Florida and I received my Informed Delivery mail the same day as my email or the next at the latest. Thank you.</div>

The mail delivery I received today had a cardboard box (along with my mail) SQUEEZED into my mailbox damaging the  door to my mailbox (as well as the package) as the mail carrier must have tried to close it.  It probably took more time to do this than drop off the package at my front door.  Also, our mailboxes should be CLOSED in order not to attract theft. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I have always had a great experience inside this post office on Post Blvd in East Manatee (Lakewood Ranch).  They are generally very helpful and patient.  However, the mail carriers for this delivery area are a different story.  One of mine is lazy, provides false information to superiors when I call to file a complaint to this office, and leaves mail on the ground if it doesn't fit in the box! So....I've had ONE supervisor at this location that contacted me back but received no resolution to the problem as I've continued to have other similar events.  Therefore, I can't say much about the powers that be at that location being very impressive if you have an issue and their ability or desire to fix the problem.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Hi again! :-)
Thank you so very much for being so prompt and thorough! Had a funny feeling this was mechanically related  (keys not fitting boxes) and why the poor carriers were having such a rough time..
Tell them thank you..theyve done well considering the situation :-)
With it being a new development, this stuff happens no doubt, and it gets ironed out :-)
And thank you for helping to find Michael's school books ..we let him know the USPS is on It! He was relieved, and happy too (can't wait to show him and Christina, his sister, the Halloween giphy you guys have up on FB..theyre going to love it! :-)
Ok..thanks again..and high fives for a job well done!
:-)

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Hi guys, looks like the problems still happening. I don't think it's our regular carrier..hes awesome..and really accurate..but when we get subs..its a mess..We live at Greyhawk Landing off of 64..our mailboxes are at a centralized spot..Whats happening is mail getting out in wrong boxes, being given keys to boxes that don't open, and the subs aren't exactly helpful not friendly..(they ignore you while your asking for help, key or wrong mail piles in hand). Yesterday was a humdinger, there was an actual crowd of people,  at the boxes, all trying to see who got who's mail! Later that night we got a knock on the door, someone found our mail in the box and was kind enough to bring it over &lt;3 
One young man was expecting a package, and his key wouldn't open the indicated box, so the crowd was helping him go, literally, box to box!! And that darn thing didn't open ANY box! Sounds like you guys are going to get hit with a truckload of complaints. These are good people..mostly working professionals ..so they really don't have time for this and would prefer not to (That's what they were saying) but they have no other recourse.
After someone brought us our mis delivered mail..it dawned on us..the kids school books! Where are they!
Checked the tracking info..sure enough..said delivered to our box FRIDAY.. We never got a key let alone the books! And no..not on our porch either..Our 4th grader needs his math books..they were ordered and properly planned to arrive on Friday, as scheduled, every year..but this year, at our new home in Greyhawk, now he's two days behind..Monday and Tuesday..and this is not an isolated event..
So my poor husband gets to take time out of his work schedule to call you this morning..
Is there ANY way we can get these sub workers properly trained (we've been told, by them, when asking why the keys don't work and where's our mail, collectively..in groups!.."I don't know" (don't care attitude) then completely ignored..move on to next box..) if this is a training issue? And the issue with keys that don't open boxes? Is that a retool of the box issue or wrong keys altogether? Anytime you get the now infamous 2P key..you know you've got a 50% chance it will work! That's a running joke here now..and it's not at all funny.
Once we got the 2P box key..it opened one of the 2P boxes (not ours, had to hunt..)..opened that box..and inside? Another 2P key!! We couldn't believe It! A scavenger hunt?? So we went and tried all the other 2P boxes (and yes, we were waiting for that package) and it wouldn't open ANY box! In EACH case..mail, packages, were found in NON 2P boxes..
with no keys left at all! Just sitting dead in a box where no one can find it until the carrier opens everything up with their key!
This is unacceptably past frustrating..as I'm sure you can understand too :-)
Anyhow..there you go..
I know our guys needs time off..etc..none of this happens on his watch..but those subs! Please look into this..and please find which box Michael's school books were put in! It's math..the one subject you absolutely cannot fall behind in..and that's why we order early every year..and it's never been a problem like this.. &lt;3
Thank You!
We love the post office..lots of our friends are carriers..and we have great respect for the service, history, etc.. and I really hate typing This!
Have an awesome day!
Oh!!! We really like your Halloween giphy on your FB page! So adorable!! Reposting :-)
&lt;3
Teresa Davis
(PS..I know they're busy and I absolutely could not do their job! So hats off to even the subs! This is a wrinkle that can be fixed..new house development, box, etc..Im confident! And again..checking the mail and seeing you guys is a highlight of our day! We love hoping on our bikes to go check the mail! We're like you..rain or sleet or even hail,  keeps our family from checking the mail! &lt;3. )   </div>

My mail box lock has become very difficult to open. Sometimes it will open immediately, other times it will take dozens to tries to open the box. I tried graphite, WD-40, no positive result. When it finally opened 
I checked to see if the nut was loose, and it was not. Can it be repaired or does it need to be replaced?</div>
