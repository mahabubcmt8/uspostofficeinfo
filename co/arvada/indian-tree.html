Would you instruct the mail carrier to retrieve our package and bring it to our house.

Also, the mail carrier has quite frequently mixed up our mail with our next door neighbor.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I have owned my home for over 30 years.  For most of that time the  Post Office provided great service.  Lately the service has been atrocious.  Like many others I have had the missing package shown as delivered.  But, what they have not noted is that the Postal Carrier left no note showing an attempted delivery -- NOTHING.  Thank God for tracking numbers, as they let you know the Carrier LIED when they claim delivery.  

Calling the Indian Tree Office reveals that the management does not require the carrier's to come to the door on signature required deliveries, nor do they require them to leave a note either at the door or in the mailbox.  The Postal Service accepts these packages from the pharmacies.  They even charge extra for providing the signature service and have also repeatedly fought against anybody else using MY PERSONALLY OWNED mailbox.  If you or I took custody of a package we had no intent of delivering in accordance with the shippers instructions and charged extra for services we had no intenson of performing we would be guilty of grand  fraud when you look at the size of the USPS.  Of course the Indian Tree Post Office could be an outlier for its fraudulent business practices, but I doubt it.

It is time for the laws protecting the Postal Monopoly of our mail boxes be removed.  That way service providers that are actually willing to fulfill the contract they enter into when they take possession of the package.  Also, the postal carriers would never have to leave their trucks -- at least until they get reposssessed.  Sounds like a win win contract.   </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">USPS was supposed to deliver a package to me. My house does NOT have a mail box on the curb we have a community mail box. The package was marked delivered. I checked my mail box when I got home and the package was not in my box. I checked my front porch, sides of the house and behind both fences on each side. No package. 

I called the company that I order it from and they referred me to the carrier (USPS). I called them and started a missing package case on it. I waited 2-3 business days to follow up. When I followed up the supervisor I spoke with said the package was probably mis delivered. This has been a problem for the past year or more. USPS has marked a package delivered but it was never delivered to my house. I told the supervisor this and he said he would look into it. All I was looking for is answers to where my mail is being delivered. 

We have gotten to know many of our neighbors due to them having to bring us (or we bring them their mail) our personal mail as they often receive ours mixed into theirs.

At this point the USPS rep said he had no further answers for me. Again this was over the phone not in person. He said the job of a postmaster is not easy and would LOVE for me to come in and work for a day. I kid you not this is what their response was to me. I told him tomorrow would work for me. He clearly was not ready for that answer and he replied with "well I would have to get that approved." 

We went on for a bit longer and I finally asked for his name. He said his name when I answered but I was at work (metal fabrication) so I wasn't able to clearly hear him. At the end of the phone call I asked for HIS supervisor he said he was not in today. I asked for his name and number. He REFUSED to give it to me.

After finishing my work day I went to the post office and asked for business cards and a complaint form. The supervisor I spoke to in person said they did not have any business cards or complaint forms. When he realized I was the person on the phone from relayer he said  and I quote "what is your problem?' I starred at him in disbelief and he then referred me to the 1-800 number or the website. I questioned why a NATIONAL business/company does not have any complaint forms or business cards. I also asked for his name and he said he did not have to provide that information. 

As I was talking to him I noticed he was wearing a badge with his photo, first name, and LAST name. When he noticed me looking at it he flipped it around so that i could not get his name. I was able to get his first name but not his last. He then informed me that I wrote down the wrong last name. So i asked him for his last name. He said that he did not have to provide that as it was personal information. (but it was/is on his work ID badge) I told him I was not going to complain about his personal life just his work professionalism.

The conversation then took a very strange turn. He said I was acting suspicious and moving toward threatening. I asked how so, I am only asking for information for a complaint. I have not raised my voice or been unprofessional. He said I had all the information needed and proceeded to say "If I need to call the police I will, now I am going to ask you to leave the post office." I gathered my belongings and left at this point. 

As a whole USPS and their employees have no concern, proper  process, proper follow ups, or logical solutions found or provided for me.I am again left with having to find my own resolution to my mail dilemma.  

I recored (video) the whole time I was in the post office on my phone. I understand that having a job and dealing with people can be hard but he could have been more professional with the situation. Dave F (?) is not a nice person to deal with at this location. 

A corporation of this size needs to figure out how to be sure the clients are getting their mail and that they are delivering the mail to the right homes. There is a ton of information someone could gather about me from getting my mail. I do not believe we will see any sort of resolution but I hope to bring attention to this in hopes to put and end to this mindless and senseless mail delivering. </div>
