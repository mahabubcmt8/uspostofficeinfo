My packages are no longer coming reliably to our house. One of my packages has been marked, "Out for Delivery" for five days now. When I went to the Post Office to inquire about my packages, they could not tell me why this is happening. There were other customers in line that were having this happen to them too.

Also, Lakewood Cultural Center mailed a Certificate of Authenticity to me on Jan 18th for a painting that I purchased.  I STILL have not received it!!  Why are you unable to hire an adequate number of people??  Used to be that government jobs with their benefits were desirable.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">The following information is the recent tracking history of two packages:

August 18, 2021, 5:04 am
Arrived at Post Office
EVERGREEN, CO 80439 

So the packages were in Evergreen at a little after 5 am on 18 August.

August 18, 2021, 6:10 am
Out for Delivery
EVERGREEN, CO 80439 

So within an hour they were reported as "Out for Delivery".

But now the tracking information states:

August 19, 2021, 12:10 am
Awaiting Delivery Scan
The delivery status of your item has not been updated as of August 19, 2021, 12:10 am. We apologize that it may arrive later than expected.

Delivery is now expected to be by 9pm on 20 August.

If they were "Out for Delivery", how can they be awaiting a "Delivery Scan"?

I am writing at 8pm on 19 August.  The Evergreen Post Office Has has these packages for almost 40 hours as of the time of writing, and it seems I must wait perhaps 24 more hours for delivery.  My house is about 2 miles driving distance from the Post Office.  If the packages were "Out for Delivery" yesterday morning, why am I waiting until tomorrow evening to receive them?

Also, sporadic mail delivery this week.  This spring and summer Evergreen Post Office seemed to have fixed the issues that plagued delivery over the winter.  Thanks for that.  But how does it take two days to deliver a local package, and why the conflicting information  - "out for delivery" - "awaiting delivery scan"?  Oy.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I have been trying to call the Evergreen post office on redial for 1-1/2 hrs and they are not picking up. I can't say that this is a surprise as we have horrible postal service up here. After we got a new postmaster and additional employees we were promised better service. We even got a letter from the new postmaster apologizing for poor service. Not much has changed and since this is a government run service, there is not much we can do as customers.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I am incredibly disappointed by our local post office delivery.  Instead of delivering to my front porch they drop packages in front of the middle bay of my garage.  This has resulted in my driving over packages as I back out of the garage.  There is a sign on the garage that asks that all packages be delivered to my covered front porch.  We keep the sidewalk clear and can't fathom why our wishes should be ignored at the cost of damaging deliveries. I have been into the post office before with this complaint and clearly my concerns have been ignored.  Surely you can do better than this!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I’m so frustrated pissed at USPS over what’s become a deceitful pattern. I order a items through Amazon, much of it for work, and on their delivery dates. USPS simply lies about when a package is delivered. The snail mail approach with USPS isn’t the issue, as it’s a given. It’s their misrepresentation that they delivered a package when they know they didn’t. This seems like a recent issue. Originally, when I saw that they claimed the delivered an item and I didn’t receive it; I contacted my neighbors to see if it was dropped off at the wrong house. What I’ve come to realize is that USPS now falsely claims they delivered a package when they knowingly didn’t. It always takes another 2-3 days after they claim they delivered it until they actually do; but sometimes never do. I can’t help but assume they misrepresent this info to Amazon in order to mislead them that they’re meeting the delivery obligations, knowing they didn’t. USPS - please stop representing to Amazon that you’re reliable in delivering packages. I’d gladly pay more for any other service to deliver a package, on time or really deliver it, than go through the frustration with you.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">A Good Samaritan brought several empty boxes and envelopes addressed to me that he found along a nearby highway along with other opened empty mail. Then today I
nearly ran over two boxes in the middle of the road. I stopped to put them by their mailboxes and one of them was actually mine. Why can’t the local carrier deliver my packages to the Dropbox on my driveway just 200 feet from the road he leaves them on? I, too, get notified that packages were delivered (from Amazon) and I go searching for them. The PO marks them delivered 24 hours sometimes longer from when I get the notification? Finally, I have found my deliveries on two other peoples porches. My Dropbox is closer and yet they drive to an empty house and leave my deliveries. Honestly, I’ve never seen such unreliable service. Maybe your drivers aren’t trained or are overworked?  </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This post office has been marking all our Amazon (and probably other's) packages as "delivered" when they reach the local post office (at 5am usually) rather than when they are actually delivered to their destination - sometimes a couple days later. Beyond frustrating, seems like a very dishonest tactic to make their delivery times seem on track. I'm guessing this is the new post master's solution to local complaints on mail delivery issues...</div>

This is completely disrespectful and unforgivable.  I know about filing a complaint for damaged items but I feel this type of incident should be posted also.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Thanks so much for NOT delivering my packages and taking it upon yourself to decide my home was abandoned. A friend was picking up the mail while working on our house and missed it a few times so all the rubbish mail piled up. 

Now I've had packages get returned to sender! 
Wish there was a way ONLINE that I could have changed this while I was overseas! Now a trip to the postoffice.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Lost packages, unreasonable delays, and rude staff. I received an email that I had an attempted delivery on a package that required no signature. I went to get it and because I did not have the pink slip I was told I could not pick it up and they were unable to find it. The package was already 3 days late and now I will not receive my package that was instrumental to the weekend vacation I had planned. When I explained my situation I was told to speak with the postmaster, who of course was out for the next 4 days. I will never use usps again. From now on I will use ups or FedEx, two companies built on customer service.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This is the 6th package of mine that has been lost in the mail. This time it was NOT FOUND! I cannot claim my package because i did not buy insurance on it! My other packages have been found because they had the address it was scanned to, this time i was told that there is technical difficulties with the scanner! This post office is very rude and unprofessional! i had to call for a week to see if my package was found and the first time i mentioned it to the lady, Stacey did NOT mention this to anyone at the post office. I can't even order packages because I'm afraid they will be lost in the mail and never returned! I'm very upset that this keeps happening!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">We have lived here for 36 years and have always had great comments regarding our post office. Not so any more, not sure what has happened, but the service in the post office along with their attitude has gone down hill. At least the lady who delivers our mail is still as great as ever.</div>
