<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Walked into an empty lobby on Oct. 28th. Asked a simple question, only to be misinterpreted. I repeated the question, but that person refused to acknowledge the question and repeated the answer that did not answer the question. That person must have believed I did not understand English (I'm Asian, but was born in U.S and fluent), and spoke in a slow manner with hints of racial prejudice. I'd equate that person's disdain to someone that was frustrated at not being able to get a tinder date, ever, or mom just died and was asked to work. I feel sorry for that person - perpetuates the worst behavior in people. If you can't spend 2 minutes with a person, befriend a rock. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Went to West Nyack Post Office, 720 West Nyack Road, West Nyack, NY on Friday, October 2, 2020 at 1:00 pm.  I am always, kind, nice and empathetic to people that work with the public as I too work with the public.  This time, I have had enough and will never return to this post office as the woman behind the counter is the most obnoxious, rudest and most disrespectful person I have ever encountered in a civil service or public job.  I approached the counter (there is a line of people behind me) and she was too busy to take me as she was texting under the counter.  As I stood there for a solid minute or two I was not acknowledged "at all."   When the Queen allowed me to approach her throne, she said, "Come up" (not: hi, thank you for waiting, how can i help you?)  Now as far as Covid protection, I had to move and climb under a plastic shower curtain and place my box to be mailed on the counter.  The woman continued to text and didn't even greet or even look at me.  I began to discuss the box with her and she asked me:  "you need tape" i said no.  She said "we are NOT responsible for anything stolen in the box. We don't want to hear about it if it is."  I said no worries as it is not expensive.  Then she said to me in this condescending voice and look, "you need a label on the box."  I said I have it here.  I then asked her, where should I put it and she looked at me in disgust like I asked her a terrible question. Her rude behavior, lack of customer service and her in ability to have common sense  made me rip the box from the counter and shout to her that she has a terrible attitude and is miserable.  I stormed out through that disgusting clear shower curtain.  She shouted back at me to "have a nice day."  Now, I have been in there a few times and she is always rude, texting and making paying customers wait.  There must be many other people who would want her job, fire her and give it to someone who really wants it and is a pleasure to deal with.  I miss the man who use to be behind the counter, unfortunately, he passed away.  He is irreplaceable and she is a disgrace to the US Postal Service. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This past weekend (05/21 Saturday). I had to experience the very same workers mentioned below. "Old rude guy with glasses" and "younger really nasty guy". I will echo Tami's comments below and confirm that ten years ago the "younger really nasty guy" was there and is/was/ still is very unprofessional. We had to go take pictures elsewhere because they stated (1st) the camera was broken, then when we returned they (2nd) where out of the paper for the pictures. Yet they were taking pictures of children? We started on the list at 11.15am waited until 12.40pm, left, came back at 1.48pm and sat and waited to complete my daughters passport application. We watched  for hours (until 5.15pm) as the "younger really nasty guy" screamed for an interpreter for folks who could not speak English, as well as he wanted them to then, complain under his breath about how they need to speak English if they are getting a US passport. Once the interpreter was there he processed their (interpreter) passport before the people who were already standing waiting immediately in front of him. In addition, we listened to him degrade people, curse, complain, and be told/yelled at not to waste our time or waste his time. Once we were called, "Old rude guy with glasses". Started of with yelling. I said to him "Do not raise your voice at me. I have been sitting here for the last 3 hours waiting and watching you folks operate, if you continue yelling at me. I will yell back." I spent the next several minutes with this man, he is un professional, unresponsive and simply unhappy.

I will not go on and on about the lack of service or civility at the Palisades Mall Passport Kiosk for passports. I will however ask "Why are these folks still working here?" And, I will follow up and speak directly with the Post Master for this location which I found out today is the West Nyack Post office. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This is a comment in regard to your employee at the Palisades Center Store<br/>3302 Palisades Center Dr, in the Palisades mall. Recently we had the necessity to apply for a passport for my husband. We came equipped with all necessary paperwork, needed a photo, which we later took, and had the entire fees, to pay both with our money order and debit card. Your employee who was working that day, (man without the glasses), was rude and dismissive. We asked him for additional information and he proceeded to answer us with snide and rude remarks, and was unnecessarily disrespectful. The other employee (also a male, at the general counter, who wore glasses told us to speak to a manager but the manager had left). When I asked the employee for his ID or name or badge number he refused to give it saying "that is personal and you are not entitled to that info. Basically, he was extremely rude, disrespectful and a very angry person, and I will never use that store again.</div>
