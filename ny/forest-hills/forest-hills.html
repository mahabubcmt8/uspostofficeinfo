The managers are not properly trained or educated and so they train their employees to be as rude, lazy and unprofessional as they are. The only reason they stay open is because there isn’t another post office within a reasonable distance for those in the community. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Encountered the NASTIEST two women here today.  Went to get a passport for my baby, we had a 10:15 appointment.  Upon realizing we need the original copy of her birth certificate not just the copy, we asked if we could run to our apt to retrieve it - about a 2 minute walk.  That caused a big uproar, gossiping, venting and frustration from the two nasty women.  They finally agreed to let my husband go while I did the rest of the process.  When they notified us we also needed our baby with us, I said okay yea sure no problem he'll pick her up and be back here in 5 minutes - note there was NOBODY ELSE IN LINE.  At this point it was 10:20.  Well, that make this horrible woman freak out and tell me how un prepared we were and that now we had to cancel the whole appointment because it was now 10:22.  WHAT?? what sense does that even make.  The service here is pathetic.  These women are nasty.  I said calmly, "please can you just be kind and help?  It took weeks to get this appointment and it makes no difference that now my husband is coming back with the two things needed instead of the one we already agreed to."  Ya know, a logical point?  But these two buffoons didn't want to hear it.  What they wanted to do instead is treat people terribly, exercise the limited power they have in their lives in this role they have, and provide no standard of customer service at all.  Shame on this place.  It's clear there is terrible management, no expectation of how to treat people, and there are no consequences.  I hope the USPS goes out of business, and I'm sure with service like this, you will.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">This branch needs to train their employees how to work (service) the public.  Its no wonder the USPS is not successful in meeting their financial goals. I went to the Forest Hills, NY branch today to speak to someone about mail delivery and the girl behind the counter was on her cell phone!! What!?  When she finally waived to me and i got up to the window to ask her a question she was combative and not helpful at all.  This young lady must be in pain or wounded in some way.  It is no wonder the USPS is failing and looking for a bailout of more tax dollars.  Use another method of carrier service if you can.  This poor display of customer service is not worth anymore of our tax dollars  More money won't help with the poorly managed employees unless it's used to train them.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">the worst service that i have been able to receive is in this place, especially by its manager wost, according to whath her co-workers informed me that it was Mrs. wost or whatever her name is spelled but that was the name that one of her co-workers gave me.
I have made my corresponding appointment at the machine that they have in the locality, i needed to renew the passport of my daughter, a minor 11 years old at the moment.
the day that i was supposed to go to the appointment Mrs wost the manager supervisor &amp; employee ask from the very firt moment aggressively who had came for a passport renewal , I raised my hand while i was doing the line. Mrs wost send me to window number 2,  Not being number 2, I had filled out the form to present it, I did filled the blue form that says renewal of passports plus the brown form did not say renewal of passports, with a shout and i dont know Mrs wost  she told me thati had filled out the wrong application , grossly send me to fille the brown one the one that not say renewal. I only told her at the time the brown one does not say renewal instantly with another shout and out loud voice she answered me get out of here and go fill out the application again, I replied, why do you treat us like that? I am a user of this place, were is your courtesy for customers, i say to her, more highly with her voice she told me to get out here again, my daughter my wife and I we walk away from the window and we just look of each other, likewhats going on. we whent to fill the form and when we come back to her (Msr Wost) she told us to fill in the contacs number been already filled out, i told her which one spat its filled having already put the corresponding ones and not having more.
she look for another box on the application and came back with another scream or yelled at me saying that was not understandable, I repeated tha same question againg why the aggressive attitude towards us, the lady told us at the momenty you dont have more time retire whitout giving more explanations of what i should do in order to process my daugther`s passport book. Mrs wost got up from her chair and having verbally withdrawn she contradicts herself by calling one of her co-worker`s telling her to attend me by doing an action with her finger and her expressionless face towards us, the next perso looks at the application firts  saying that everything is fine, but unexpectedly she also told to retire that me time up, I replied, you told me that everything its ok with the form why you may me retire, also her and curtly and also with a loud voice told me to make a new appointment, i told her i don`t think it is fair you have spend my time treating us badly and giving us hard time with the applications and now no longer waht to attend us? at that moment a colleague of them joined in  and very different in his attitude towards us he reviewed the application and told us that its fine but that we had to make another appointment, I answered him since we already here why just do the process and he say that he have to to with Mrs wost the supervisor with an answer from Mrs wost saying that we have to leave because the next customer its following.
    gentlemen`s these are the types of racist behaviors on the part of a person`s like Mrs wost (supervisor &amp; Employee) who has a position working post office  there was no at all courtesy, professionalism and respect for people . i want to tell you that the post office that its located at 106-28 Queens BLVD forest hills NY 11375 and specially you MRS Wost   have lost a client it may not be importtant but I invite you clients to read the comments and see many of the people who comment`s this site, agree greatly regarding the service provide at this loation.   please I ask human resources to do  a more thorought examination of the skills to deal with the public before giving them a chace in front of the community. so we as tax payers dont  let`s be abused with power of being behind a desk at the post office like Msr Wost.
I clarify that the place is not bad, bad is the service that some people provide within this location such as Mrs wost ( supervisor &amp; employee.
   ATT.. A citizen of this community and of this blessed country </div>

<br><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Mail arrived today...OPENED, TIED IN A RUBBERBAND and placed through the mail slot.  An item in the larger envelope which was opened was missing along with the slip with my billing information.  I will be bringing this to the attention of the police dept for tampering with another persons mail.  Unless the carrier dropped the whole bundle and someone picked it up, opened it up and then slipped it the slot which is unlikely, this would have me believe the carrier him or herself had gone through my mail, figured out what they wanted and then wrapped a rubberband around the bundle and slipped it through the mail slot in a steel door which is locked.  Will contact post office and fine the name of the carrier, Wish me luck..</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Lost my package, it was delivered to the wrong address. 2 weeks so far and no resolution from the post office. It was suggested to me which address it might have gone too. Post office suggested I go to that address and ask for my package back. or track down the realtor of another address which the package may have gone too to ask them to open the door since the house is vacant. Like really? This is your fault, you guys should fix it. Not endorse your mess up to me. So I went to speak to the supervisor who was upset because she was about to eat lunch. Told me there is nothing that can be done. They cannot find the package because the status was delivered even though it is not. They told me that it is out of their hands and is now my problem, I have to open a claim and fight it out with their claims department. Then I was told to stop calling and coming in about the package, just talk to claims.</div>
