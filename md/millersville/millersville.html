Ireceived 9 forwarded Christmas cards today.  It is February 6! I also received a $15,000 check that was mailed from DC  on 19 December and a couple of way overdue bills.   The mail forwarding has gotten MUCH worse since the branch reopened.  This is really pitiful.  I'm wondering if I'll ever get  tax documents...</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I cannot believe the total incompetence displayed at this post office. This is not the first time that I’ve had problems with putting mail on hold at this facility. Four days before I left for a holiday I went online and filled out a hold mail request. Then three days before I left town I went into the post office and filled out a bright yellow card to put my mail on hold. On both forms I indicated that I would pick up all accumulated mail upon my return. When I return today I stopped at the post office and lo and behold there was not a single piece of mail there for me. I checked my mailbox and it was filled with mail But less mail then there should have been. I cannot understand why it is so hard for the employees at the Millersville post office to follow very simple instructions.</div>

Tons of begging letters, campaign stuff,outdated coupons,  sales BS, and in between I found my car registration stickers and other personal mail.  All I need is some explanation.  </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I live in Pondview, a new community in Millersville. We consistently receive mail in our box for other individuals in the community. Today, there was a total of 26 pieces of mail belonging to other residents in our box. Other residents are experiencing this problem as well. The boxes are numbered and show the correct address. It almost appears as if the postal carrier is dumping mail into any slot. The 26 pieces I got today were associated with 12 different addresses, some of which use a completely different mail box on another street. This is unacceptable, unprofessional service. Prior to today, I had walked around the neighborhood and hand delivered the misplaced mail. As of this load, I will start placing it back in the outgoing box for the carrier to deal with. Someone needs to address this at a higher level.</div>

My mother dropped a letter in one that contains three prescription requests for my dogs, which has not been received yet by the recipient.  I'm concerned that the mail is not being picked up from the boxes as I was told.  Can anyone tell me if their mail from the boxes has been received?</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Daphne, I hope you have answers to your questions by now. As I write this, it's 1/18/2018. There was a big fire at the Millersville PO on January 5, 2018. All postal operations for Millersville are now being handled by the Severna Park PO, including delivery, which can be very late in the day for Millersville residents. It may be several months before the Millersville PO is repaired and open for business again.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I'm so sorry to learn your bad news. The only thing I can suggest is to keep calling every day! The Severna Park PO number is 410-647-2904. I have a problem with that PO, too. I got an automated email message yesterday, saying that a package I had ordered last month had been delivered to my address. I got no package. When I called to check on the problem, I was told that the package had been delivered to 8299. There is no 8299 on my street. The person I talked to said that nothing could be done about it. So I will keep calling, and will visit the Severna Park PO in a day or two if there is no resolution.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Usually the service here is pretty good, but I just got yelled at by one of your clerks for asking about an email that I receive from the USPS concerning a package. The email contained an attachment which was not possible to open on any of our devices. So, I drove to a USPS location to inquire. She said I had an improper package number but it was the only number I was given . She proceeded to tell me several times that she could try putting that number in but nothing would come up in the system. She also informed me that the email did not come from this post office so she couldnt help me. I thought the USPS was one big company, not little tiny offices all unconnected to each other. I tried to tell her I did not know where else to go, but she got annoyed with me and yelled for somebody else to help me, but nobody else was there so she had to deal with me. I told her that I knew that she was not personally responsible for this problem, but she seemed to like raising her voice and confronting me as if I were from Mars or had gotten lost on my way to the crazy house. So please, teach your people a little courtesy and patience, there was no reason for her rudeness other that she felt cornered because she didn't immediately know the answer. Also please teach them where to go when they cannot immediately find the information we need. I see that they make pretty good money from your website, so maybe some courtesy and respect should be worked into that salary.</div>

Our mail delivery has been mixed up quite often in the past 3 months.
Is there someone in charge that can straighten out this problem.

We had or mail delivered on time and correct for many years.
Thanks.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">They can personally check to see if a mail forward has been placed on your mail and see who it was done by. You would just need to talk with the post master or supervisor, not the clerk. They have much more access to information than the clerks do. Doing a new forward could screw up your mail even more if you have not gone to the above authorities to see if that forwarding activity that has been placed on your address. You also did not have to pay money to change your address, you simply could have filled out the change of address card for free at any branch. Do yourself a favor, talk to the postmaster or supervisor instead of paying a lawyer to go after a lawsuit that is going to go no where. Why would the mail person want to deal with your complaining over mail? They wouldn't. It is there job and if your not getting your mail there is a reason beyond a disgruntled carrier.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I have experienced problems with the delivery of my mail at my home. This problem started in February of 2014. I feel that the letter carrier is taking in upon himself and redirecting or forwarding my mail. I am looking into filing a lawsuit with an attorney due to my mail possibly being discard or lost by the said letter carrier. If my mail is not delivered then where is he taking my mail that he does not want to deliver to me? It is not being returned to the senders. And to make sure there was not a problem on the other end , I myself have sent mail to New Jersey with a self addressed stamped envelope. And still after 4 weeks I have not received it. I also mailed a letter locally to myself here in Maryland and still have not receive that letter and it has been 12 days. There is an obvious problem and I have spoken with neighbors who have the sameletter carrier and our boxes are all connected and they have experienced no problems. I moved here from another apartment with in the same complex and there was no problem at the prior address and after going online and changing the address to this new address last year around April 2013. I had no problems. But starting in February 2014 I have had continuous problems receiving my mail. To the point of contacting senders of the mail which had money orders in them due to me , I questioned their mailing of said items. But Iwas shown copies of money order receipts and the said mail never got returned to them. I am so frustrated that I have no other alternative it seems but to file a lawsuit. I have been told in person after showing the clerk at 221 Najoles Rd, . Millersville , MD Post Office that books I am waiting to receive(and I have the tracking number) that I myself did not have it forwarded. I even supplied her with a copy of the order with my current address that the book was shipped. And still she said I myself had it forwarded. To where I ask? Why would I forward a book or any of my mail to where I do not live? I am not forwarding my mail , it is being discarded , forwarded or lost by the letter carrier on his own. I have even had to go online(2 days ago) and pay $1.05 to once again have a change of address(which should not be necessary) done because now they at the Millersville , MD Post Office are forwarding my mail. I went to the old addressed apartment and no mail. Where is my mail? I want my mail , book and letters. I want it all. Where does it go , or what did they do with it? Why is the Post Office blaming me the customer for there mistakes? I have done nothing wrong. And I am the one suffering. I do not want the people at the 221 Najoles Rd , Millersville , MD Post Office to call me. I WANT MY MAIL FROM FEBRUARY AND MARCH FOUND AND DELIVERED. It is so sad that I have to feel this way because I am the shy quite type. But I have reached a breaking point. Please help me! This all makes no sense , if were at fault I would say so at once. But I am not. All of these problems are not of my doing. And if you can produce a current document saying I had my mail forwarded to other than my current address then I will prove to you that someone at the U.S. Postal Service is covering their trail of ineptness.Old address prior to April 2013:<br/>Jeffrey v.
