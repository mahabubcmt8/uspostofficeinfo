<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">We had a letter that did not require a person just a signature, so we signed the paper and returned it.  We didn't get the letter.  I called the Westminster post office about 7 days later to check on it.  Megan answered the phone, she asked me to hold.  She came back to the line and I explained.  She listened (and heard me) and asked me to hold, she checked and has the certified mail there.  They didnt get my slip.  She was EXTREMELY helpful and super quick to get me an answer.  I really appreciated that.  I wouldn't normally post a review but all I see about this office is negative reviews.  I just had a good experience and that should be noticed also. Half of the country isn't working so we need to respect, appreciate and be more patient with the ones who do show up and do their best!  </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Our mail carrier is delivering packages and leaving them on the busy street by the mailboxes with no protection (had a Stitch Fix box, clearly marked, left on the side of Bachmans Valley Road in the pouring rain), or most recently just drops the packages at the end of the neighbor's drive. How hard is it to drive a few more feet and deliver to the correct house? I have tried calling the Westminster PO to complain. Phone just rings, no one picks up!!!   I guess I will have to go to the post office in person to complain, which will be another complaint!  So frustrating!!!!  I wish Amazon didn't use the USPS.  I'm all for people having job security, but I prefer the people DO their jobs correctly!  Had my mail on hold while on vacation.  The entire week's worth of mail was delivered to yet another neighbor.  Constantly getting calls from neighbors stating they have my mail or packages.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Have lived in Westminster for over 30 years, and never has our Post office been this bad. Mail mixed up with other peoples (exposing everyone to identity theft), bills arriving late or in other peoples boxes, and mail truck not showing up until after 8:00pm at night.  Lazy mail person won't bring packages to door or placing in mailbox, so we're required to drive to the post office to pick deliveries up in person. Call the Post Office to check the status of your package before making the extra trip... and phone rings endlessly with no one answering.  USPS employees' jobs haven't been threatened with experimental injection and/or mask mandates like the rest of the working class, so I'm not sure what the personnel problem is (???) </div>

They never answer the phone, instead picking it up and immediately putting it back down to stop it ringing (I heard them do this several times just today).

The mail carrier must be blind, constantly delivering mail to the wrong address (often the wrong STREET) for at least a decade.

This post office is why I avoid using USPS any time I possibly can.</div>

I have had several packages of importance, including medicine, left outside at the top of my driveway by a planter.  This is not always seen.  I have 2 porches and 3 pathways.  The medicine sat out there in the cold overnight.  I was assured this would not happen again by the postmaster.  Unfortunately, it just did.  This never happened in 18 years until now.   I will keep trying to call, but please see that this matter is corrected. Talking to a human being is impossible.</div>

On Saturday, I received 5 pieces of mail delivered incorrectly to my address. This morning, I attached a letter stating that this was not the correct address and please redeliver. The mail person did not do so. Furthermore, I am expecting replacement credit cards for the ones that were stolen. God only knows where they are and if they were delivered to some other address. This nonsense has been going on for quite some time and I am getting tired of having to run throughout the neighborhood delivering mail that was incorrectly delivered. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I entered your facility on November 12 to send two packages to Connecticut.  Realizing that I neglected to acquire adequate insurance, I came back within minutes to ask if I could add insurance.  From that point on, the degree of confusion and utter carelessness is beyond any human’s attention span.  Currently, one of my packages is showing no signs of delivery, no one is answering the phone and my credit card has been grossly mischarged.  The bottom line to anyone using this facility is that your business is better conducted elsewhere.  The reviews you are reading are accurate.  This facility is a disgrace.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I live at 341 Jasontown Rd. 21158 and share a driveway with 335.  It is Sunday, September the 6th.  At approximately 1:30 this afternoon, one of your postal workers made a parcel delivery to 335.  I did not see them when they entered the driveway but I certainly saw them when they left.  When you enter my driveway there are 2 bright yellow signs warning of children at play and a 10MPH speed limit.  I cannot tell you exactly how fast they were traveling but it was certainly no where near 10MPH.  This is my DRIVEWAY, not an extension of RT140!  You need to instruct your drivers how to respect my property.  If for some reason you are unable to accomplish this request, you'll force me to take some sort of legal action.  I have five grandchildren here this weekend as I do many other weekends and I will not stand by and allow your drivers or any other drivers for that matter, put my grandchildren at risk.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text"> I paid money for a Amazon Prime membership and was suppose to have a one day delivery on Saturday, but instead they lied about my driveway being blocked so they couldnt deliver a package that could have went in the mailbox to begin with. The regular mail was delivered but not the package, and it's not even like my house is that far away from the road anyway, its literally 50ft, UPS and FedEx drivers pull into the bottom of the driveway and walk the short distance but apparently the lazy USPS cant do that, but that's besides the point because there was nothing blocking the driveway. So it sounds like the dumbass USPS forgot the package and then made a excuse for not delivering it. So instead of a one day delivery it turns into a 3 day delivery. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Must post once again my frustration and dismay with this post office.  Now my regular mail carrier is not whom this about.   Last night I was notified by text that my pkg was delivered and left on front porch.(I had been waiting two weeks for this to arrive and was worth over $60.  That was a lie....it was left on top of m paper box in the snow and left for any passerby to steal.  We can't see our mail box front our house, must walk up to see.  These after hrs mail carriers probably being paid extra overtime are lazy. thoughtless and inconsiderate not to mention again out and out lied.  Today I call the P.O. told my issue to whomever, got the run around by him passing the buck and told me Melissa would call me today.  Course she did not and when I tried to call the phone went directly to voicemail.  Obviously this post office needs better customer service and people who are willing to do their job and stop leaving pkgs out in plain sight to be stolen.  It was a sad day when UPS hooked up with the postal service.  Our UPS guy is fabulous and our daytime regular mail carrier is pretty darn good too.  Once she made an error and was very concerned to fix it.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Apparently we pay for delivery to our house for our convenience but Westminster office has decided that they will no longer deliver to my house because it's to far from my mailbox. So I pay for delivery to them and am inconvenienced by having to go get my packages. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Oh an apparently it's because their drivers are getting into accidents on the driveways per Steve at the Woodward Dr. Office.. I am complaining every couple of months because this is the worst post office I have ever had to deal with. My packages have been delivered several times by a man who lives a half a mile away from my house and vice versa!!! Lazy and incompetent employees in my opinion!!!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">A package was to be delivered today Sept 5. I checked e mails and it said that the package was delivered to a resident. I do not know who,the resident was because only my husband and I live at the delivery address. My husband has medical,issues and is not able to accept a package and I did not receive it. Hopefully it was delivered a cross the street at my son's house and they have not delivered it to me yet. If not I hope that it was delivered to my other next door neighbor. Guess I will find out tomorrow.

I have complained so many times the staff at the post office recognizes  me when I walk in and still no one does anything.

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">A package was supposed to be delivered yesterday.  I received the following message when I check the status:  Carrier is unable to gain access to front door to deliver the package. Please contact the carrier to resolve  Westminster, MD 
That is a blatant lie!  My house doesn't have a gate or anything else that would prevent access to deliver the package.  I saw the mail carrier stop at my neighbors house yesterday.  Too busy or lazy to stop at mine?  This isn't the first time I've had an issue with packages not being delivered on time when the USPS is the delivery service.  And just like everyone else, I can't get through to the PO in Westminster.  Also, if the mail carrier "can't gain access" why aren't they leaving a note in my mailbox that I have a package to be picked up at the Post Office.  I don't anticipate my package being delivered today, either.  </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">You can add my name to the others who have packages whose last noted location was the Westminster PO.  According to the tracking information, it was supposed to have arrived there on 12/09/16 and was to be delivered on 12/12/16.  The package has yet to be delivered on 12/31/16 and the tracking website reflects that fact.  You may also add my name to those who have either gotten a busy signal or have had the phone ring for 5 minutes at a time before it cuts off without anyone answering it.  I have been calling steadily for 2 days and no one has answered the telephone yet.  It's enough to make me want to drive the 10 miles to the PO and "go postal" on them.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Oh my gosh!!! I so agree with you. I have not been able to get through on the phone either. Today was another one of those days!

Also, my mailman doesn't leave certified letters because he was "too busy". I saw the pink card and it put it right in the box. In our development he goes around around our side of the street and then turns around and goes through again. My husband walked out to catch him to ask why he didn't let us know as it required a signature and Saturday is the only time he is home. I died when my husband said he was too busy. I had a huge box of inventory that required a signature in the same week. It was a Friday. I let the phone go until someone picked up. I lit up their butt and I said someone WILL deliver this package TONIGHT!!! With much hemming and hawing - they got someone to send the package in which we desperately needed. I have 3 family members that work for a PO and they tell me what to do. So, that's what I did. Also, you can start filling out complaint forms at usps.com. It started doing that. I am not a complainer at all, but when this nonsence started to happen; I decided enough was enough. Of course he slipped up several times after and the post master begged me to call there instead of leaving a note. Well, if you can't get through to the phones, what other choice do we have?</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I went to the Westminster PO this morning (since they don't answer their phone, I had to) only to be told that it was likely that they never had my package in the first place, only that UPS had made an electronic transfer but that was no guarantee that it had gotten to the PO.  I was advised to contact the sender of the package to advise them that I had not gotten the item ordered and to re-send it.

I put that on my "to do" list but lo and behold! - the package which had been in limbo for almost a month appeared in my mailbox this afternoon.  Coincidence?  Maybe.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">For at least 3-4 years, we have continually received the incorrect mail delivered to our mailbox. Just today, March 7, 2015, I removed 7 pieces of mail that belong to our neighbor. Their name is not even similar to ours, and we get other neighbors' mail as well. We have even received mail that was not even the right zip code. I have complained in person to the Westminster Post Office more than once, and it just gets worse. Our mail is also delivered to the wrong address, and those people then have to bring it to us. This is just getting more and more ridiculous every day. The primary goal of the postal service is to deliver the mail to the correct recipient in a timely manner. Our mail goes everywhere other than our mailbox, and we continue to receive our neighbors mail almost daily. I am so fed up with this. It seems to me the postal deliverers should at the very least be able to read a name and address correctly. Isn't that the primary role of a postal carrier?</div>
