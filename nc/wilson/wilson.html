<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">When I resided across town on Timberlake Drive, there was never a mail issue. Packages were left at my door for days as I completed my relocation. I sold my house on Timberlake Drive and moved into my rental property that was once my father's. Biggest mistake Ever. The regular mail carrier was in the process of retiring and this stand in was and still is a night mare from Hell. From the moment I moved in there were mail issues.  I forwarded my credit cards and my billings to the new address located in Walston Property Subdivision. All of my mail and credit cards were returned to the sender. Then I get a call from NYC Regional Office of Veteran Affairs to ask where exactly do I reside. This incompetent, vindicate Big Black lady with the floppy hat sporting The USPS uniform sent all my military documents back to sender. This was the start of a paper trail of phone calls, written complaints and numerous visits to the post office at Mercer Street. After months of stress, a new carrier was put on the route. 18 months later he retires. Several replacement carriers were put in place and did a awesome job until the Big Black Lady with the floppy hat wearing a USPS was assigned to fill in for our route. She would get to the home next door and when it came to my address she would turn the mail car around and go in the other direction. Either I got my mail days later or another carrier would bring it hours later. My neighbors and I had a good run of peace of mind and consistency. There was a Postal Pick and the Big Black Lady with the floppy hat picked our route, as of May 22, 2021. Now the nonsense starts back up again. No mail delivered this past week to certain households in my subdivision, including my household. I am beyond frustrated and am taking matters to a whole another level. I am quite sure this will both put Wilson NC on the map and stir up the Mercer Street Post Office.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">A very sad example of an American Post Office.

They do not answer the phone - ever.

Apparently this office is well known for having a poor reputation in the community.

I called several other Post Offices in the Wilson NC area and ALL of them answered.

One of the Post Office associates at the 1470 Tarboro Street location told me that I should not even bother trying to call the Mercer Street Post Office because they never answer the phone.

VERY unprofessional.</div>

We're the tax payers gave the Post office billions of dollars in "bail out"money, yet they can't get locks replaced so that we, those tax payers, can receive their mail and maybe pay their bills too. It's a joke. Calling the phone number is s a joke too. No one EVER answers the phone. The women that work behind the counter, act like we're interrupting their day by even showing up! </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I delivered my neighbor's mail yesterday to their mailbox.   This isn't the first time.  I had my  mail on hold from Monday until Friday.  I received my held mail yesterday except for Monday's mail, which I got today.  I have to resort to getting my bills on line since I can't rely on the post office to deliver it.  I see our postman circle around and up and down the street all the time.  What's going on?</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I get it...I know what its like to deal with the public. But the woman that took Russell's place at the Mercer St. location should not be allowed to deal with the public. I gave my business for over 20 years to the Mercer St. Branch. Running a successful eBay business. Now I take great pride in never having to set foot in the place. I made the mistake of  using the click n ship to sent a dvd (small package) to my cousin in Tarboro. Cost me $7.31 Priority mail. I put it on my mailbox with some letters which were picked up by the carrier on the 21st. I've checked the tracking every day and it showed it was in the pre-shipment phase. I didn't pay much mind as the tracking site ran a banner saying you were working on computer site problems. After checking yesterday (the 28th) it still reads the same. I took the receipt down to Mercer yesterday trying to explain to this rude woman (I detest to deal with her) she finally concluded it was my fault since the PO did not have it. I tried to explain to her that my carrier needed to be contacted about it as she had repeatedly lost my mail, misplaced packages that were supposed to be delivered, then found in her vehicle the next day. I figured she had been riding around with this package since pickup. Miss rude talked to me like I was her dog...dismissing me and barking at me to move to the side as she passed my receipt on to one of the many hundreds of "supervisors" that roam Mercer. No worries. I learned my lesson. I spent years working retail and on my worse day never talked to anyone the way this person did (and does). I won't make the mistake of dealing with you again.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">We’ve lived at our home for a little over a year now and I’ve never had an issue with my mail getting delivered at any other cities I’ve lived in the past 15 years. 

First off my house is 100 years old, the mail box is hanging on the side by the front door. When we moved in, in June 2017. I wasn’t receiving my mail due to “address is undeliverable”, than my mail was getting lost/going to my neighbor, now they came up with I have a dog, so I need to put my mailbox at the driveway because the mail carrier is afraid of dogs(mind you, I’ve had my pup since May of last year and he is the sweetest/friendliest pup we’ve had and wouldn’t hurt a fly). I had the mail master(Kimberly Pittman) come out, she told me she is not feeling threatened(I have recording of her saying it). Two weeks after she came, I was still not receiving my mail. I went back to the post office, spoke with her(mail master) again. She told me to write a complaint letter and drop it off for her at the office. I wrote the complaint, dropped it off on the same day. Two weeks go by again, no mail. I called Tuesday morning to find out what was going on with my mail, she told me that she did not open my letter and she needs to have inspectors out to my house, because what she “thought was safe, now it is not” she does not know when it will happen. I asked when was I getting informed about all of this, she said she didn’t have my phone number(LIE!!! I gave her my number varies times over the phone and in person). I am stay at home mom/wife/business owner meaning most of my time I spend in my home office(where I have monitoring cameras) working. 

Mail master told me that the mail carrier told her that I confronted the mail lady......first of all, I’m not that type of person to get down that level to speak with mail carrier. If I have a problem, I’m going to someone higher than you. I’ve never spoken to the lady. I just came back from vacation in the mountains. So there is no way that I spoken to the carrier. I also have cameras at my house and proof that my mail is no where near being delivered. 

P.S. We never received any notices about having a mailbox at the end of my driveway or to even have a mailbox that is detached from home. 

All I want is my mail to be delivered! </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">On Nov 285th my neighbor came to my door and advised me that our mail cluster box was left open with the carriers key still in it. Everyone's mail was left open to be taken. We tried unsuccessfully to close and lock the box. The right door would not close. I called the main branch on Mercer st and advised the person that answered of the problem. She stated, "he probably didn't realize it was left open" and that she would call him. I said how could he not know with both doors left. She answered rudely, "I'm not fittin to argue with you and hung up on me. I have been trying to call back for 15 minutes to speak to a supervisor and no one will answer the phone. Rude customer service!!!!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Every time I have been to this branch, the employees have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help me. Even when I have called and needed help on the phone, they have been most helpful. courteous, and professional.  Occasionally when I call, I know it does get hectic sometimes, I either don't get an answer. When this happens, I call back later.  But once in a great while, I have to call when it is hectic. Even if I have to call back several times to get an answer, they are still very courteous and professional.  I have the greatest respect for these employees.  Sometimes I see them at other branches, and am always glad to see their smiling faces. </div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">Rude employees. I called because a package was supposedly delivered to my house on April 15, I found this out after the person that delivered it to me wanted to know why I never mentioned it was delivered. Was told to call back after 1:00 pm, because the manager stepped out and she was the only one that could check the tracking on it. I kept calling and calling with no answer from anyone.</div>
