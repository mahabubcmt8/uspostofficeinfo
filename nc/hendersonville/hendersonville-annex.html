My work paychecks getting lost in the mail. The arriving time of mail coming at more later hours every time. I'm just VERY DISAPPOINTED and MAD!! This affects my company of my bills charging me late fees and ruining my credit or having my utilities disconnected because I am not getting my bills in time. I will be getting a private mailbox and see if my mail will come in on time. I will need to speak to a supervisor right away. I understand the short staff at work. I work 4 jobs myself because no one wants to work. So, please.. I need a supervisor CALL!! THANKS. A VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER!!!!! </div>

Our mail has been arriving 5 hours later than usual for the past week, so I waited until 6 p.m. before checking online again. The new message says "held at PO by customer request" Hardly!! (How can you hold it when its already "out for delivery" anyway?)
I don't know what's going on, but I WILL get to the bottom of it tomorrow - can hardly wait to hear the explanation!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!!! 
Last week they delivered (if you can call it that) our package down the road from our house. Just left it on the side of a four resident shared drive. Two sides were torn completely open and the contents were hanging out and some things were missing. When I called the annex, I was told the delivery driver tried to tape it up. There isn't any additional tape or tape residue on it. And why was it just dropped in the middle of nowhere?? No explanation. Now today.... We've been waiting for a package that was due to be delivered today. Checked status online and it shows "attempted" delivery. NOT. Called annex. Very rude man argues and said they were "holding" it for me to pick up, "because that's what I told them I wanted to do in the future." ...Yes, I told them I always wanted to receive my packages a day late and drive over to pick them up myself... again, NOT! These people are ridiculous and like some other reviewers stated, we could write a book about all the other times they've not done their jobs. And on top of everything, just about every time there's a problem, the employees are so condescending and rude.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I am so tired of one of the mail carriers on my route. On February 4, 2018 the mail carrier was scheduled to deliver a package to me that I needed badly. I sat and watched for the mail carrier all day waiting in anticipation because I had an order to fill.
At 2:55 pm I seen the mail carrier start to pull into my drive way. I got up and went outside to meet him/her like I always do. I got out my front door and the mail carrier was gone. I seen the mail carrier sitting at the end of the road I live off of for about 2 minutes and then drive off. I came back inside my house and waited to see if the mail carrier would come back because they have forgotten a package but always come back.I waited for 25 minutes and no one came back so I called the Mail Annex For Hendersonville NC 28792 that delivers my mail. I made a complaint that the mail carrier didn't even attempt to deliver my package. I asked that my package be brought and delivered. The lady said that she would look into it. I got off the phone and went to amazon.com and checked the tracking for my package. It now said, "Package was undelivered, couldn't access the front door". I was immediately upset. I had someone else call to see what was going on with my package. We was notified that the mail carrier insisted that they was afraid they would get stuck in the mud and we was more than welcome to come to the Annex to get my package. OK, now i was fuming mad. They are telling me to come get my package when the mail carrier didn't try to deliver it to me in the first place. I said ok, and i went out and video recorded the paved road I live on and proceeded to record the road all the way to my house and then to my front door. In the video it is plainly noticeable the tire tracks of the mail carriers jeep and the tire impressions from the jeeps tire where she pulled 5 feet into the beginning of my drive way and stopped, backed out and just leave.I have a well maintained driveway and the mid week mail carrier never has a problem and has never got stuck in any mud. There isnt even places in my recorder video where anyone could possibly get in any mud to get stuck. 
                     OK,
 I AM TIRED OF OUR MAIL CARRIER LYING ABOUT DELIVERING OUR MAIL AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT! SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS! IF NOTHING IS DONE BY MY COMPLAINT HERE i WILL TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND i WILL TAKE ALL THE STEPS NECESSARY TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT!

Thank you, Sincerely J.Z. Martin

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I am sick of the lack of effort and lazzines of our mail person! This is the second time something like this has happened. We have a basement with two doors, which are NEVER used and my package and mail was left there for more than a week! In the snow and weather luckily it wasn't left by the mailboxes to be stolen like an other time. If they can't walk the package to the front porch which is covered and out of the weather they should be fired!</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I do not understand why mail is not delivered in Timber Creek 1/18/18. There is no reason why???? I called the anex twice to ask if mail was to be delivered and was told that they were still out? This is not true... It is now 7:30 pm and still no mail. I have letters that need to be picked up and now I will have to make a trip to the post office to make that happen. I have photos of the road to show that there was no snow or ice at all. What has happened to the post office??? No one seems to care about anything. This is just wrong and I will continue to express my disaprovel  to the postmaster General in Washington.The service in this area is unacceptable.</div>

<br/><div class="revtext" itemprop="text">I have been trying to locate two packages that arrived in Hendersonville on 12/22 ,according to information found when I checked the tracking numbers.  The carrier left a slip for one on 12/28,but when I tried to pick it up at this facility on 1/2  I was told it could not be found and was possibly out for redelivery.  Needles to say,it was not delivered. The carrier never left a slip for the second package. I found out that it too arrived in Hendersonville on 12/22 by checking the Amazon website. On 1/3 I attempted to arrange for redelivery of both packages via the USPS website,but authentication of my address was refused.  So I finally succeeded in scheduling redelivery via the automated telephone system for 1/5. The day came and went with no packages,no slips. According to tracking the packages are in transit,in theory somewhere in Henderson county. I have tried calling the number for this facility provided on the internet but it's been disconnected. When I try to call the main PO in Hendersonville,which all  my mail is supposed to come through,all I have is a busy signal. I have not had time to get to this facility before it closes since 1/2. I suppose I will have to get off work early to do so,but it wouldn't surprise me if the packages can not be located. I never had cause to complain about the USPS before,but this is inexcusable.</div>
